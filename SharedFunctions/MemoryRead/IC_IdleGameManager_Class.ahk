; GameManager class contains the in game data structure layout

; GameManager class contains the offsets as found in mono-disected memory structures. Specifically, the offsets for the IdleGameManager structure.
; It was designed to make future updates easier by clarifying where each offset is found and (hopefully) reduce the difficulty of updating offsets for structures that remain largely the same.
; - Variable names are based on the layout within the structure not including GameManager itself. e.g. this.Game.GameUser will be IdleGameManager->Game->GameUser.
; - Each offset is built off of a previous offsets. e.g. this.Game.GameUser.ID will be this.game.GameUser + ID, or IdleGameManager->Game->GameUser->ID
; - GameObjectStructure is what is used to combine offsets.
; - Items defined by "List" will have an Item[x] offset that is dynamically selected in code via object.GetGameObjectFromListValues(x).
; - There can be multiple missing list offsets as the game can traverse multiple lists to get to the value you want.
; - i.e. Instead of using:
;            this.Game.GameInstance.Controller.UserData.HeroHandler.HeroList.UpgradeCount
;   you would use
;            this.Game.GameInstance.Controller.UserData.HeroHandler.HeroList.UpgradeCount.GetGameObjectFromListValues( hero_id )
;   as hero_id will tell it which hero from the HeroList is being accessed.
;   Each extra list used will require an extra location passed. e.g. GetGameObjectFromListValues( first_id, second_id, third_id )
